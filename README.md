# Movie Rating System

Recommender systems are most commonly recognised as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. 

“In October, 2006 Netflix released a dataset containing 100 million anonymous movie ratings and challenged the data mining, machine learning and computer science communities to develop systems that could beat the accuracy of its recommendation system, Cinematch (Bennett & Lanning, 2007).

 Given a dataset of movies, users and their ratings, you are to create a recommender system. 
You must: 
•	Search for a movie 
•	Rate a movie 
•	Recommend a movie specific to the user based on their rating 
•	Have a GUI 
•	Use persistent storage (i.e. store the data in a file)
